# learning_with_passive_optical_nonlinear_mapping

This repository contains the code and data used in the study "Learning with Passive Optical Nonlinear Mapping." We constructed a passive optical nonlinear mapping setup with nonlinear optical components to demonstrate its learning from hihgly nonlinear optical features. The repository provides the code used for training and analyzing the data produced by the setup.

## Repository Contents

- **`data/`**: This folder contains the partial data collected through the passive optical nonlinear mapping setup, due to the limited storage Github allows.
- **`code/`**: This folder contains the code for training and analyzing the data produced by the setup.

## Quick Guide

1. **Data Collection**: The data collected through the passive optical nonlinear mapping setup can be found in the `data/` folder. The data includes partial experimental results as well as simulated data.

2. **Code**: The `code/` folder contains the code used for training and analyzing the data produced by the setup. It includes code for preprocessing the data, training models, and evaluating performance.

3. **Training and Analysis**: To get started with training and analysis, navigate to the `code/` folder and run the Python scripts provided. Detailed instructions on how to run the code and reproduce the results are given within the scripts.
